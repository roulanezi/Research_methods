<p>R can make complicated things easy and the package below will save you a lot of time. In your assignments you should have tables similar to the ones you see in official reports and journal publications. The <code>stargazer</code> package will allow to do this without having to update your table multiple times.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(stargazer)
stargazer(model.1,
          type=&quot;html&quot;,
          out=&quot;model_one.doc&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using LATEX instead of Word you donâ€™t have to specify the type and the output (out).</p>
