The most common measures of central tendency are the mean, the median, and the mode. These are the basic measures attempting to describe the data you would like to explore. In simple words descriptive statistics such as the mean, the median, and the mode, provide summaries about your population sample. 


Descriptive statistics are distinguished from inferential statistics. When you are using descriptive statistics you are only describing your data. With inferential statistics, you are trying to generalise from your sample about the whole population. 
For example, we use inferential statistics to infer what voters think about the current party in government.

Alas, we use inferencial statistics to make inferences about the whole population and we use descriptive statistics to describe our data.
